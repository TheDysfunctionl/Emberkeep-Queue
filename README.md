# Getting Started

This application is "portable," which means it doesn't have a formal installer. Follow these simple steps to set it up:

**[Download Latest Release](https://github.com/TheDysfunctionl/Emberkeep-Queue/releases/latest)**

### 1. Create a Folder
Create a new folder anywhere on your PC (e.g., on your Desktop or in Documents) and name it something like `My Application`.

### 2. Move the .exe
Move the downloaded `Emberkeep.Queue.exe` file into that new folder. 

> **⚠️ Important:** When you run the app, it will automatically create `config.dat`, `queue.json` and `session_state.json` files. Putting it in its own folder prevents these files from cluttering your Desktop or Downloads folder.

### 3. Run the App
Double-click the `Emberkeep.Queue.exe` file to start.
>Emberkeep Queue will take a little while to launch the first time you run it.

## Note on Windows SmartScreen
Because this is an independent project, Windows might show a blue **"Windows protected your PC"** popup when you first launch it.

**To run the app:**
1. Click **"More info"** on the blue screen.
2. Click the **"Run anyway"** button that appears at the bottom.

## What are these new files?
After running the app, you will see new files (`config.dat`, `queue.json` and `session_state.json`) appear in the folder. **Do not delete these**, as they store your settings and queue data!
